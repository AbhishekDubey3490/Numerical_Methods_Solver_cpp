# Project_c++
Implemented various numerical methods (Bisection, Newton-Raphson, Secant, Gauss-Seidel) to solve nonlinear and linear equations. Developed algorithms to solve first-order ordinary differential equations using Euler’s and Runge-Kutta methods.
Focused on numerical integration techniques like Simpson’s Rule and the Trapezoidal Rule.
Optimized the efficiency of iterative methods for better computational performance and faster results.
