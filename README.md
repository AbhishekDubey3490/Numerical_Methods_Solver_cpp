# Project_c++
Designed and implemented a comprehensive suite of numerical algorithms to solve linear and non-linear equations using Bisection, Newton-Raphson, Secant, and Gauss-Seidel methods. The project extended to solving first-order ODEs and performing numerical integration via Euler’s, Runge-Kutta, Simpson’s, and Trapezoidal techniques. Throughout development, the code structure was refactored to optimize iterative efficiency, resulting in significantly improved computational performance and reduced execution time.
